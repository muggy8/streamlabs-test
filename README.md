# My entry for StreamLab's technical test.

## Thoughts and assumptions

so the requirement `All messages by Kevin to Natalie's livestream chat should be stored in a persistent storage
` is the only one that applies to kevin and as a result I am to assume that the app works pretty much the same for both the "super mega fan" as does a normal casual viewer. To this, I would assume that all comments are stored permanently on persistent storage somehow which feels kinda weird as youtube probably does something like that already but I'm not as familiar with that aspect of streams as I am only ever a casual viewr (mostly LCS).

The requirements after the "stats" page seems to suggest that the stats is a special thing to this app that's not directly provided by the API vendors and it's for us to dig around and mess with i'd assume.

There are no requirements on Natalie's side meaning she doesn't actually interact with the SV app at all nor does she need to know about it's existance.
